# Walk-Demo
This is an WIP game. I am still learning how to create a game engine and everything so it's also a learning tool for me.

I ask that if you are going to use this as an outline for something you create please credit me!
Also if you are a more experienced programmer or game developer I would love feed back on things
that could be changed to improve effeiceny and just make it overall better.
